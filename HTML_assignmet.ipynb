        "\n",
        "Answer :- DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML :\n",
        "\n",
        "The **DOCTYPE declaration** is an instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used in the document. It ensures that the browser renders the webpage correctly.  \n",

        "### **Syntax of DOCTYPE in HTML5**  \n",
        "```html\n",

        "- This declaration must be placed at the **very beginning** of an HTML document.\n",
        "- It is **not case-sensitive**, but it is usually written in uppercase.\n",
        "- It does **not** have a closing tag.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose of DOCTYPE**\n",
        "1. **Defines the Document Type** – Informs the browser that the document is written in **HTML5**.\n",
        "2. **Ensures Standard Rendering** – Helps browsers display the webpage in **standards mode** instead of **quirks mode** (which can cause inconsistent rendering).\n",
        "3. **Improves Compatibility** – Helps modern and older browsers interpret the webpage properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of an HTML5 Document with DOCTYPE**\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
        "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
        "<head>\n",

        "<body>\n",
        "    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
        "    <p>This webpage follows the HTML5 standard.</p>\n",
        "</body>\n",
        "</html>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Older DOCTYPE Versions (For Reference)**\n",
        "- **HTML 4.01 (Strict)**\n",
        "  ```html\n",
        "  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **XHTML 1.0 (Strict)**\n",

        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Conclusion**\n",
        "- The DOCTYPE declaration is essential for proper rendering.\n",
        "- HTML5 uses the simple `<!DOCTYPE html>`, making it easier to use than older versions.\n",
        "- Always include DOCTYPE at the beginning of an HTML document.\n",
